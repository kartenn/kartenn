## Installation

Reach out to GitHub and [generate an API token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) flagging all read access permissions. Paste it in the `.env` file, following the example of `.env.example`.

Then:

```
nvm use
npm install
```

...and you should be good to go.

## Usage

```
nvm use
npm start
```

...and you should be good to open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and explore.

## Toolkit

Kartenn is based on:

- [Bloomer](https://bloomer.js.org/#/) for [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) styling
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for fancy visualizations
- [Next](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), because—you know—you gonna need a framework
- [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) for talking to [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v4/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for fancy, shiny code
